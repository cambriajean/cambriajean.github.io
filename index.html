She brings a unique perspective to her movie reviews due to growing up in a hyper-critical, only-child, east-coast household (Paris' words). She was not allowed to have pets and now she is obsessed with my dog, Primrose. She would describe her passion for film as average.</p>

It was distracting he was suck a dick. Also, Geena Davis' outfit made me question the 80s."</div>

Seeing herself as a matchmaker, Cher first coaxes two teachers into dating each other. Emboldened by her success, she decides to give hopelessly klutzy new student Tai (Brittany Murphy) a makeover. When Tai becomes more popular than she is, Cher realizes that her disapproving ex-stepbrother (Paul Rudd) was right about how misguided she was -- and falls for him.</div>

It was very reminiscent of Home Alone with the villains. Given that it was set in the 80s, I would have appreciated a more 80s soundtrack. I don't understand why Spielberg was involved. The set was incredible. And surprisingly the misogyny wasn't as bad as I expected. Definitely some fat jokes that were unnecessary (a whole character devoted to a stereotype)."</div>

                <div class="movie-list-info-para">In this cult classic, sweethearts Brad (Barry Bostwick) and Janet (Susan Sarandon), stuck with a flat tire during a storm, discover the eerie mansion of Dr. Frank-N-Furter (Tim Curry), a transvestite scientist. As their innocence is lost, Brad and Janet meet a houseful of wild characters, including a rocking biker (Meat Loaf) and a creepy butler (Richard O'Brien). Through elaborate dances and rock songs, Frank-N-Furter unveils his latest creation: a muscular man named "Rocky."</div>

                <div class="review">"I truly did not know what to expect. The whole time I was wondering 'who approved this script?'. And then I remembered it was the 70s and there had to be heavy drug use involved. I appreciate the boundary breaking dismissal of sexual norms and the full expression of pleasure and individuality. Tim Curry is legendary. I have no reason to see this movie again. It's a one and done."</div>

Despite their strong friendship, their personal and professional lives are still lacking. When they hear of their upcoming high school reunion, they take it as an opportunity to show their classmates how much they've changed -- first by trying to reform themselves, then by creating a lie that eventually spins out of control.</div>
